# KQL in Action

## Introduction

### Usage
This is a collection of exercises, answers and explanations to help new KQL users learn how to write KQL.  
By executing commands (operators, functions) that appear frequently in actual KQL usage situations from various angles and in various ways, the user is expected to learn the commands by hand.

### Term

In KQL, as in any other programming language, each language element is given a name. Remembering these names is not mandatory, but it is a good thing to keep in mind in order to improve learning efficiency. Rather than simply lumping everything together as "commands", you can quickly gain a better understanding of how KQL works by being aware of which elements you are currently using.

- Table operator: This is the most commonly used operator. It accepts table input and outputs a table. Elements that appear at the beginning of the process or next in the pipeline are table operators.
- Scalar operators are mainly used within table operators. They include numerical, logical, and string operators, and perform data processing such as the value of a particular column in each row of a table. It is difficult to distinguish between and not-between from the functions described below, but between and not-between are scalar operators.
- Function: The meaning is the same, it returns a specific result. Some functions perform processing on input values, while others return values without taking input values. Note that they are similar to scalar operators.

- [Log Analytics DEMO workspace](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring_Logs/DemoLogsBlade)  
This is a demo workspace with sample data. The KQL on this page is intended to be run against this data.

- [Kusto Query Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/ja-jp/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/)  
This is the reference for KQL in Azure Data Explorer, of which Log Analytics is a partial implementation.


## Basic  

### Find out where to find the information
To search the Azure Monitor logs, you need to know what tables are in the workspace and what structure each table contains records. Here you will learn how to use basic operators to find tables that contain the information you are looking for, and how to examine the structure of the data contained in the tables you locate, using the most commonly used tables as the subject matter.

### Format data

{{<kql lang="en" category="Basic" kind="format">}}

### Specify and format the date

Azure Monitor logs have a standard defined column, the `TimeGenerated` column, which indicates the time generated by the data source, allowing you to see the time of the log record. Using the `TimeGenerated` column, you can filter based on time and the number of records.
